Through my years of software development I have had access to many tools that helps me achieve the results and features I want.There is two tools that have ultimately helped me the most when thinking about solutions.Those two things are .........

### A Pen and a Piece of Paper

Yes,those two "ancient" forms of jotting down notes.In this modern age the pen and a piece of paper is probably the most underrated tools.Wireframing,brainstorming or just jotting down a simple list,you are in control of what goes on that piece of paper,that paper is not on somebody elses server,it is yours,just yours.I can literally look at a page in my personal notebook right now and I see many things.A sales funnel,a unneatly drawn app mockup,an sketched icon of some sort.On the next page I see some mathematical formula I wrote up when trying to create a solution to a programming problem on [Project euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives "Project Euler").I also see a "Things to learn" page listing languages and frameworks to learn.It is so powerful to even write down some quotes that reasonate with you one the front page.

Yes you could draw notes on some app you get from the play store and get somewhat of the same outcome,but what you miss is the ability to write notes without distractions,to brainstorm without getting a notification from whatsapp or twitter.You have control over everything you write.

So,buy a small,cheap notebook,or even[ those fancy moleskine ones]() if you fancy it.Have a business idea,note it down.Maybe you need some space to draw a giraffe,draw to your hearts content.Want to write down your monthly budget,write it down.The power is in your hands.
