Fiverr,What is it though

Fiverr is a popular marketplace for services starting at just $5.

Everyday,tons of people are buying and selling services through Fiverr.
The most popular services that are offered range from programming, social media marketing,writing and graphic design.People from all around the globe visit fiverr to offer  their services and expertise or buy services from the sellers on the platform already.

The secret to earning money on this platform is to start pricing your services to the minimum which is $5 for a while until you can about 2 to 3 reviews.Then you can start increasing prices and make more money at the same time.Remember when you earn money with Fiverr, they take 20% of whatever your orders revenue is.For example lets say you start creating Facebook covers,somebody orders and you priced your service at $5.when you complete your order and you deliver and your client accepts delivery,$4 will go to you and $1 to Fiverr.

So now go and **[Join Fiverr Now](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/656fa8f9ca)** as a seller and lets discuss the most important aspect.What should you sell on Fiverr. Here's how you can start your first developer gig.

There are various types of development you can do on fiverr such as website development(using weebly squarespace etc),unity games and scripts development,javascript(nodejs,angular etc),you can fix bugs in php or java code or any programming language for that matter,you can even develop excel macros(high demand).The sky is the limit.The more niche your gig is the more you'll be able to charge for it.

Now comes the time to actually create the gig.Assuming youve signed up you should be taken to the sellers admin and have the options in the top of your page that says "Gigs".Click on it.

You should see a new page appear where you can see you have no gigs yet.Click the "create a new gig" button and now you can start creating your first gig

The first field is your gig title.This should indicate what you will be doing for the client
For example let's say you are creating a gig where you will be fixing php code bugs.Your gig title should be something like I will fix bugs in your php code.
Remember when it comes to fixing php bugs,theres probably someone selling exactly the service you plan to sell,so you really need to make a impression on the potential buyer to lure them to buy your services by differentiating yourself.

The next field is category of service and that stuff.You just need to make sure your gig is in the correct category,which in this case is programming.

The next thing to do is to is to add some search tags.THESE ARE IMPORTANT.You  need to add search tags that are relevant to your service.You also need to make sure you add some keywords that are mentioned in your gig title.In this instance we will add the following search tags.you can add a max of 5 tags.

fix bugs,php,web development,code,php script

Now we can save and go to the next tab,the pricing tab.This is where you  will be telling your client how much your services will cost.

By default you are expected to have one package.Packages are what your gig will include
so where it says Name your package you need to name it something fancy like Gold Package or something to that effect.
Fiverr gives you the ability to create 3 packages.You should probably make use of that.
Moving on to the next box that says Describe the details of your offering.This is where you need to in a few lines describe what the client will be getting upon puchasing the package
So in this instance it will be something like
"You will a bug fixed within php code"

Next you need to choose in how many days you will deliver the gig.This is up to you,I'd suggest making it 2 days for safety sakes and because you can charge extra if the client wants to get it in one day.

Depending on the category of your gig the next few options will differ so fill in the rest of the stuff including the price.Revisions are a thing where you need to choose 1.Revisions are basically how many times the clients can adjust things within an order.

Below you will have the option to specify gig extras,which are extras a client can purchase as part of their order,this will increase the amount of revenue alot if done tastefully,such as charging your client for an extra revision or giving the option for your client to get extra faster delivery of their order.

In the next section you need to describe your gig to your potential client.Here is a good template to follow for this specific gig
------
Hi there im available to fix php code bugs and write php scripts and im here to do a quality job
Why should you hire me and not someone else
-give two/three reasons and to why they should hire you
Looking forward to working with you.
------

I recommend to leave out the Frequently Asked Questions for now.Once you have started
getting some clients you can fill in that section with the most frequently asked questions.

Requirements section
Just add a requirement saying "explain your requirements"

Gallery sections
This is important ,it is the image every sees when they see your gig at first.You need to make a  really nice graphic of size 550 x 370 on Canva to show off your services.The best choice is to keep a consistent template for your gig images and just change text and images.You can even use **[Canva](https://www.canva.com/)** to make the gig image.
Remember dimensions must be 550px by 370px.

Once you are done with that,your are ready to publish your gig.Once your gig is published it sometimes takes up to 24 hours to appear in the search results for the searches that includes your gigs main keywords such as in this instance "fix php errors" or "php bug fix" etc.Your gig probably wont be at the top,but the more reviews and orders you get the higher it goes.

Fast forward to getting your first client,treat all your clients with utmost respect.Most clients will normally message you before purchasing a gig from you.So make sure you
communicate nicely with your client and make sure you deliver only quality work to your clients.Some clients also give you ideas for other gigs you might want to create through their demands.
