Imagine,its a weekday,you wake up at 11am,take a shower,eat breakfast and then complete a task and send your client their work.By 1pm the client has replied and payment has gone through to you and you start with sending another client their contract and estimated timeline,you promise to deliver the full project in 7 days .You code until 6pm and then call it a day.You and your friends go to a movie and enjoy a dinner out.

Now that is what i would call freedom.I am currently doing by Computer Science Degree,after that ill probably work for a year or two,but my ultimate goal,is the above paragraph.I'm not saying this without having experienced freelancing already.I am fortunate enough to have some decently long holidays.About maybe 2-3 years ago I decided that i would try my luck with freelancing.My first client,a cousin of mine who is in the real estate business.I created him a website with Wordpress , I even implemented some custom features for him.I felt great after being paid.My second client was also a family member,another cousin.The project that was given was built in django and it was a crud web application.The pay for this one was much higher than my first job.

Now in the meantime I happened to stumble upon Fiverr(Yes Fiverr,that site you can find people to do things for $5).Except I worked at it and I happened to not be the seller with mediocre work and $5 gigs.Soon I started completing gig offers for $80-$100.Keep in mind i chose a very niche gig within the Data analysis and reports section so anyone who wanted this niche service,i was well in the first 3 results that came up.Put it simply I am really good at what I do and the things I offer,so when people get their jobs done really nicely and quickly,they often buy the same service again . A lot of people say "With freelancing you just do a job for a client and you done".Well if you are good  at what you do and you communicate with your clients' nicely ,there is a good chance they will work with you again they have another similar task.Now its obvious i wont be spending my life working on fiverr,it's given me a decent income for just working in the holidays.

Ideally i would like to open a contracting/consulting office in the city and do freelance consulting out of there.I've also kind of got a business plan going for that goal of mine.

So anyways I do not know exactly what life will be like in the future,but if theres anyone I would like to work for it would be myself.
